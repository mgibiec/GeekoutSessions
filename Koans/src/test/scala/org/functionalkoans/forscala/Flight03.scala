  // 1. Has class parameters real and imaginary
  // 2. an auxilliary constructor that takes just a real double and creates a
  //    complex number with a 0 imaginary value
  // 3. has an overridden toString method that prints out the number in the form
  //    "<real> + <imaginary>i"
  // 4. has overloaded + method that creates a new complex number with a real
  //    part containing the sum of the real parts, and an imaginary part containing
  //    the sum of the imaginary parts
  // 5. has a second overloaded + method that creates a new complex number by taking
  //    a double and adding the double to the real part
  //
  // The tests below should exercise all of these requirements although they
  // are far from exhaustive
