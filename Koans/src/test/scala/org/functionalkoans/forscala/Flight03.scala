  //    complex number with a 0 imaginary value

  //    "<real> + <imaginary>i"
  // 4. has overloaded + method that creates a new complex number with a real
  //    part containing the sum of the real parts, and an imaginary part containing
  //    the sum of the imaginary parts
  // 5. has a second overloaded + method that creates a new complex number by taking
  //    a double and adding the double to the real part
